A little bit about the client side.
For the design we used much more CSS than in our last project, thanks to the knowledge that we earned in the course.
Moreover, we learned by the time of the project how to use in bootstrap package the made our site much more elegant.

For the functionality, the main use was taken by Angular technology that we learned how to use in the course. 
From ng-click to ng-repeat and more than that.
We think that the website is nice and pretty and we hope you will think it too.
